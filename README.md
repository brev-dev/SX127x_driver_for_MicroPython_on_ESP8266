### SX127x (LoRa transceiver) driver for MicroPython on ESP8266

This fork of [Wei1234c's drivers](https://github.com/Wei1234c/SX127x_driver_for_MicroPython_on_ESP8266) ([original blog post](https://wei1234c.blogspot.tw/2017/08/sx127x-lora-transceiver-driver-for.html)) is for use with an esp8266 as a [remote sensor and MQTT bridge](https://github.com/brev-dev/LORA_esp8266_sensor_MQTT_bridge). It's stripped-down to the bare minimum to minimize the memory footprint.
